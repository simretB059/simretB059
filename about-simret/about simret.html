      <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="blank">codecademy</a>.this is
      a good website. the basics of coding are given for free. she was planing
      to pay and get the (codecademy-pro) advanced html and css lessons for a
      price of $237. while deciding on codecademy, she found SheCodes and did a
      free introduction lesson with Mat(amazing teacher!). sice she started
      taking classes here with SheCodes,her knowledge of coding has been
      improving.she is happy she found this amazing website and she would like
